# Fullstack-Practical-Case

## Goal
The goal of this test is to get a better perspective on your technical skills in software development for the role. This test will help us to know the quality of the code, general programming practices, design patterns, handling of git, attention to detail resolution of problems among other important things to know your skills.
Keep attention to this goal, because this be considered to evaluate.

## Description
You must develop an RESTful API system that allows you to carry out simple employee management. This system will be able to create an employee, edit their information, list all employees and the possibility of deleting their registration.
Information about employees: 
<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Last name</li>
    <li>Employee number or ID</li>
    <li>Date of entry</li>
</ul>
Also you have to implement a small frontend application to consume the API you developed above. The frontend should be able to show a list of employees available in the database. Upon clicking the name of an employee on the list, the user should navigate to a more detailed view of the selected employee, where they are presented with details. You should also implement a form where the user is able to create/update employees.
In general, we do not want to limit you with respect to the stack, the tools or the programming languages. But it would be a plus to develop the backend in some framework based on Python. You are recommended to use ReactJS to create the frontend, but you are free to use a different Javascript framework.

## Considerations
Remember! Itâ€™s a test to evaluate your skills. You can add new features that you consider necessary.<ul>
    <li>You will have to write a document about the tasks that you had to do to solve this test. It can be a README.md file.</li>
    <li>In the same file you must document the structure of the project and the steps to follow to run your project locally.</li>
    <li>A very nice addition would be to create a Dockerfile to build the image and run it.</li>
    <li>If you have any questions, you can send them to us! Remember that you can ask anything related to the test.</li>
    <li>Any extra dependencies should be included in the repository.</li>
</ul>
## Delivery
Send the public repository link as a response to the email to our people hiring team. (Example Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket).
